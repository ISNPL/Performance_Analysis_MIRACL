# Performance_Analysis_MIRACL
This repository contains the implementation and performance evaluation of the proposed cryptographic scheme using the MIRACL library. It includes experimental analysis of computation overhead to validate the scheme‚Äôs efficiency compared with existing approaches.

üß™ Experimental Environment

Device: Raspberry Pi 4 Model B (√ó2)
OS: Ubuntu 20.04.2 LTS (64-bit)
Memory: 8 GB
Processor: ARM Cortex-A72 @ 1.5 GHz (4 cores)
Library: MIRACL Cryptographic Library

‚öôÔ∏è Execution Guide
Each cryptographic module inside the Code/ directory can be executed independently.
When executed, the program automatically measures performance metrics.
All operations are repeated 100 times to obtain an average execution value.
